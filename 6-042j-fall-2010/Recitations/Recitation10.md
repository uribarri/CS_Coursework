## Analysis of two networks
The table requested in this problem is the following:

| network | # switches | switch size | diameter | congestion |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|5-path   | 5          | 3 $\times$ 3| 6        | 5          |
|4-cycle  | 4          | 3 $\times$ 3| 4        | 3          |

Note: I originally got the switch size on the 5-path wrong by looking at an end switch, not the maximal (middle) switches.


## Routing in a Benes network
The instructions are all completed in an attached PDF. I'm not yet a good hand at generating machine drawings for graphs...perhaps when I have a need for many graphs I'll get around to that.

Note: sure enough, the solutions' routing was a bit simpler because they followed the instructions as to which (red vs blue) should be routed top and bottom. There is only one way to do the routings once that is chosen, though, so my solution has to work equivalently.
