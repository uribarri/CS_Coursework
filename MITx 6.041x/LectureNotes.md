## Lecture 1
A sample space is a set of possible outcomes $\Omega$.

The set must be:
  * Mutually exclusive
  * Collectively exhaustive
  * At the "right" granularity (no irrelevant details)

Axioms of probability:
  * $P(A) \geq 0$
  * $P(\Omega) = 1$
  * Finite additivity

Any function (or model, as called in this lecture) that satisfies these three axioms is a valid model.
