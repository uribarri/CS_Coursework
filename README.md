# CS_Coursework
Lecture notes, assignments, and projects from various CS courses. Not complete or comprehensive.

## Basic notes on execution of CS_Coursework
I'm doing the courses as they become available in live sessions on their respective platforms. This isn't strictly necessary but I find the feedback of the grading systems and the discussions helpful. They will therefore be a bit out of order but I have enough background in CS to be able to handle it.

"Background" implies that I've ever taken a CS course. I haven't in person; I've done some online work in un-coordinated fashion. It's been 16 years since I started being an engineer (as a freshman in college) so I've been writing scripts in, for example, MATLAB for at least that long. So I get it. But I want to understand things formally.

I'm also likely to enjoy the more theoretical aspects more than the practical aspects. I'm going to push through the practical anyway, because I want my final products to be pretty comparable with professional best practices. But my goals are to do high-level type stuff; system administration, for example, is not high on my list of interests.

## Notes on the materials
I am not a note-taker by design, but I've tried to jot some things down as I go. I only have just discovered Markdown, so I'll use that in many of my notes. SPDI, unfortunately, came too early, so my notes are mostly illegible for that course. But like I said, I don't plan on anyone actually getting value out of those.

I will sync anything fairly substantive into the repo here; one of my goals is to learn Git better, since I don't know much now. Basic homework-type jottings won't make the cut, but project-level things will. This too because I plan to be working on materials in various places.
