=== Random notes for SPD Part I ===========

# Started during lecture 2, "Enumeration" as a way to stay awake
# I'm not a note-taker, so this isn't a good reference for anyone
Enumeration is for keeping track of a number of distinct values (not numbers)
Examples in enumeration are redundant. # I find it's pretty much true everywhere discussed so far.

# The rules being discussed are useful only in the sense of an introduction to something that should be discussed in more theoretical or practical terms. This is somewhere in a gelatinous in-between.

# Itemization
Itemization is for dealing with several subclasses at once
Itemization and enumeration both require functions that deal with multiple cases (predicates).
